# Regex
Regex proccessor via WPF.

Optimization branch is buggy as hell. I don't recommend this app for testing regex-patterns. It is because I've used default WPF RichTextBox for highlighting pattern occurrences. Now, it is either: 1) laggy 2) buggy. One of these. However I want to save this repository for a reason.
