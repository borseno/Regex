# Regex
Regex proccessor via WPF.

Optimization branch is buggy as hell. I don't recommend this app for testing regex-patterns. It is because I've used default WPF RichTextBox for highlighting pattern occurrences. Now, it is either: 1) laggy 2) buggy. One of these. However I want to save this repository for a reason.

You can choose not laggy version (optimized) but it is unstable.
You can choose not buggy version (old release) but it uses a bad algorithm (it always refreshes your occurrences), so if your computer is not from heaven, then you might feel some lags.

Both of these use DEFAULT WPF RTB. So it's bad :) Nuff said.
